Just saw The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep. Sitting on a bench now. God, theater was too loud, but the kind that makes your bones rattle. Reminds me of the time my buoy broke loose. So, the beginning... Geralt fighting underwater, with what — a sword made of light? Or was it water? Kinda hard to tell, the CGI was both bad and magnificent, like when you see a huge wave, but it's just a picture. It really waz... what’s the word? Disorienting.

> Sirens were just everywhere. Singing their songs, voices almost like seagulls. But way less annoying, more like that haunting tune you can’t... what was it last time... like trying to sing Jolene underwater. Actually gave me chills, or was that the AC in the theater? There he was, breathless under sea's pressure and my back just creaked like door hinge in salt air. Slides down in the seat too comfortably... which isn’t comfy.

The king with the trident... was that Poseidon or just a weirdly jacked mythological guy? Dude was confused. Also, I think someone stepped on my popcorn. Crunch made the scene less epic, more like walking on cornflakes in the morning. Why do magic battles always end so loud, seriously? Download the movie if you want, because watching the movie isn't like watching — it's like being inside a drum, but in a good way... or maybe not.

Felt like I was dogpaddling in someone’s creative nightmare. But then again, that's the thing about The Witcher, isn't it? Never quite sure if you're on land or sea, and honestly wouldn’t have it any othre way. 

Do you remember someone asked if they could ever watch the movie at home? Told them, yes, first, download the movie, and make sure your sound system is ready to vibrate your kettle off the stove.

Oh, and Yennefer had purple eyes, could’ve sworn only use of color this time — reminded me of butterfly wings, or maybe a traffic light... I don't know. Okay! Anyway, lemme know if you see it, it's like taking a blender and filling it with weird dinner party convos, sea salt, and broken sunscreen bottles.
